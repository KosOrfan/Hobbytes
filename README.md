Hackathon project
An effort to create an application which helps a city advertise itself with the help of its citizens. Main thought is that after a photo and some description a random citizen could submit a location or a place that it is known generally or personally. After a like/dislike system other citizens will review and vote such a submition and decide whether such a point should exist or not.
